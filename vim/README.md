Syntax highlighting logcat files for Vim/MacVim

- ```logcat.sh``` - script that formats the logcat output and pipes it to ```mview``` (MacVim.app's command line). Both ```adb``` and ```mview``` should be in the ```PATH```
- ```logcat.vim``` - Vim syntax file. Should be copied to ```~/.vim/syntax``` (based on [Naseer Ahmed's script](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2735))
